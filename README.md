# spring_framwork_-_spring_data
this is a project that shows you how to create a project for the first fime using spring framework core and spring data 



## What is spring 
spring is a framework that helps you to create a project in java based on the concept of inversion of control and dependency injection

## advantages of spring
- spring is a modular framework
- spring is a loosely coupled framework
- spring is a testable framework
- spring is a flexible framework
- spring is a high performant framework
- spring is a transactional framework
## spring modules
- spring core
- spring aop
- spring jdbc
- spring orm
- spring web mvc
- spring webflux
- spring web services
- spring test
- spring data access
- ## spring core
- spring core is the core of spring framework it contains the ioc container and the dependency injection
# application context
- the application context is the container of the spring framework it contains all the beans of the application
# IOC
- inversion of control is a design pattern that allows you to create a project in a loosely coupled way
using the concept of dependency injection and autowiring
- # AOP
- aspect oriented programming is a programming paradigm that allows you to separate the cross cutting concerns from the business logic
- cross cutting concerns are the concerns that are common to all the layers of the application exa: logging, security, transaction management, caching, exception handling, etc
## spring Data 
- spring data is a module of spring framework that allows you to create a data access layer in a simple way
- spring data contains the following sub modules
- spring data jpa => for the orm
- spring data jdbc => for the jdbc
using spring data you can create a data access layer in a simple way
